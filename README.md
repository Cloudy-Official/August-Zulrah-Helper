# August-Zulrah-Helper
A tool to make Hard Mode Zulrah more accessible/easier.

**IMPORTANT**<br /><br />
How to use:<br />
-Download the entire ZIP file, not just the EXE file or no images will load. If you see a red box, you didn't download the entire ZIP file.<br />
-Run Zulrah Helper.exe.<br />
-Click on one of the 6 images or press the designated hotkey to select rotation.<br />
-Press 'Space' to advance to the next image in the rotation.<br /><br />
-Press 'Delete' to return to the rotation selection or the application will automatically return when you've reached the end of the rotation.
Due to limitations with 'pygame', hotkeys cannot be used while the window is not focused. A workaround is to use the 'pynput' library.<br />
To install pynput simply open a command prompt as admin, paste "**pip install pynput**" and press enter.<br />
If you do not install pynput, you can still use your mouse to click on the images to advance to the next image.
