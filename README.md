# August-Zulrah-Helper
A tool to make Hard Mode Zulrah more accessible/easier.

How to use:<br />
-Download the entire ZIP file, not just the EXE file or no images will load. If you see a red box, you didn't download the entire ZIP file.<br />
-Run Zulrah Helper.exe.<br />
-Click on one of the 6 images or press the designated hotkey to select rotation.<br />
-Press 'Space' to advance to the next image in the rotation.<br />
-Press 'Left Arrow' to return to previous image in the rotation.<br />
-Press 'Delete' to return to the rotation selection or the application will automatically return when you've reached the end of the rotation.<br /><br />

**IMPORTANT**<br /><br />
Due to limitations with 'pygame', hotkeys cannot be used while the window is not focused. A workaround is to use the 'pynput' library.<br />
To install pynput simply open a command prompt as admin, paste "**pip install pynput**" and press enter.<br />
If you do not install pynput, you can still use your mouse to click on the images to advance to the next image.
